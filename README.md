## 🔒 Security & Privacy First
SplitWay is architected with a "Privacy by Design" approach.
- **Zero-Exposure Protocol**: No sensitive data is logged to the console or exposed in client-side inspection.
- **Admin Security**: Critical actions are protected by a 4-digit Admin PIN.
- **Auto-Logout**: Sessions automatically terminate if a trip is deleted to prevent orphan data access.
- **Sanitized Inputs**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
